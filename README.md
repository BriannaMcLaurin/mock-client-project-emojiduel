# mock-client-project-emojiduel

Client: PixelEdge Studios

Client Brief:

“We’re experimenting with a super simple, addictive game concept called Emoji Duel. It’s a turn-based reaction game where two players race to react correctly to a randomly displayed emoji challenge.
It needs to be mobile-first, super fast, and sharable via link — no login required. Just generate a game room, send it to a friend, and play. One emoji appears, and each player taps the matching reaction first. Best of 5 wins.
We’re not trying to go full multiplayer backend — just a simple WebSocket or Firebase-style implementation. If this goes well, we’ll look at native app development later. For now, we want this shipped in 2–3 weeks as a polished prototype.”
Must-Haves:
Emoji-based reaction challenges (e.g., tap "🔥" if it appears — but quickly!)


2-player real-time gameplay (room code or share link)

Turn-based: random emoji appears, fastest tap wins the round

Score tracking (best of 5)

Simple animations for emoji events

Game over screen with option to replay or share again

Mobile-first design (PWA or mobile browser optimized)

No login — just nickname and room join
